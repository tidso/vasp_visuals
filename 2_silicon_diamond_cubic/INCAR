 SYSTEM = Silicon Diamond (band)

start parameters for this Run
 ISTART = 0 ! job: 0-new  1- orbitals from WAVECAR
 ICHARG = 11 ! charge: 1-file 2-atom 10-const

other parameters
  LASPH = .TRUE. ! Essential for accurate band structure calculations of f and 3d elements
 LORBIT = 12
  LREAL = .FALSE. ! Projection done in reciprocal space
  LWAVE = .TRUE. ! Writes WAVECAR
 LCHARG = .TRUE. ! Writes CHGCAR
  ISPIN = 2 ! spin-polarized calculation
   PREC = Accurate
   LELF = .TRUE.
  LVTOT = .TRUE.

electronic optimization
  ENCUT = 500.0 ! defaults from POTCAR, but wise to include
   ALGO = Fast ! alorithm for electron optimization
   NELM = 100 ! of ELM steps, sometimes default is too small
  EDIFF = 1.0e-05 ! stopping-criterion for ELM
  SIGMA = 0.05
 ISMEAR = 0 ! -5 for sc, or 0 with SIGMA = 0.05. =1 or =2 for metals with ~0.2 for SIGMA

ionic relaxation
 EDIFFG = -0.01 ! # stopping-criterion for IOM (all forces smaller 1E-2)
    NSW = 0 ! ionic steps
   ISIF = 3 ! Full Geometric Relaxation

performance optimization
 LPLANE = .FALSE.
   NPAR = 4 ! one orbital handled by 4 cores 
   NSIM = 1
